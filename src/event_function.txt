simple-event functions
random sampling as rs: random sampling from certain distribution, by following formula, number = 'sampling_term'
move: move some distance in some direction
switch: decide if turn off the switch by following event-finish criteria
compute score as cs: computing some score by following formula, score = 'scoring_term'
make decision as md: comparing scores or comparing a score with a threshold, using following formula if eval('decision_formula')
state change as sc: change of state of human, animal and world.

simple event function


trap, catch, chase, stab, shoot, throw : rs, sc, switch
go_to: move, sc, switch
search: move, cs, sc, switch
null, gather, butcher, cook, eat, lay_down, fall_asleep, wake_up, get_up: sc, switch

All simple event has following attributes: state change, event-finish criterion(switching criterion), and some has
random sampling distribution.



making-choice functions: cs, md

making-choice functions are implementation functions which take minimum time and does not cause inner state change.
neet to specify the scores to compute, and the decision formula for each making-choice function

decide hunger or sleepiness ()
decide if acquire(animal) (0,0)
decide hunting method (0,0,0,1)
